openbve (1.4.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Openbve stable release 1.4.0.0 introduces the upstream
  content-manager for downloading external routes directly from within
  the program.  This simplifies the installation procedure for
  additional third-party content (Routes and Trains) and allows
  meaningful use of Openbve without having the bve-{route,train}-*
  packages installed first.

openbve (1.2.10.0-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  Openbve has gained has gained a new Train plugin API ("OpenBveApi"),
  for plugins written in CLR-based languages such as C#.  These
  plugins should be fully portable in source-form and are intended
  also to be portable in binary/compiled form too.  Previously the
  plugin API was based on that used in BVE Trainsim 4 and was limited
  to Win32-i386-COFF .dlls.

  An example plugin written against the new OpenBveApi and in C# is
  "UkTrainSys" by Anthony Bowden. This plugin is to some extent a
  drop-in replacement for several previous generations of the plugins
  'OS_Ats1.dll' and UkMut.dll', commonly distributed across many trains.

  Plugins are activated by putting the plugin filename in 'ats.cfg' in
  a corresponding Train/.../ directory.

openbve (1.2.4.1-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  Openbve now uses a home-grown .wav parser for loading audio files.

  The older SDL/Alut sound loader would transparently load Ogg Vorbis;
  as a consequence of this no longer working the default train and
  route data packages have been rebuilt without a Vorbis recompression
  stage and so are now larger in download size.

openbve (1.2.1.3-0ubuntu1) unreleased; urgency=low

  A marker at the front of first car is now used for
  signalling/platform positioning, rather than first axle or "beacon
  receiver" offset.  this should allow the removal of workarounds in
  route/train models.

  The "defaultexterior" configuration option has been removed by
  upstream.  It is now always true and a version of the basic "model"
  from 'Data/Compatibility/exterior.csv' is used as the default 3D
  representation for the train in semi-invisible train front (the
  "pre-train")---this model is expected to be a unit cube, that is
  then scaled to the anticipated train height/width/length.

  The default (unspecified) train data has been adjusted:
  + CarHeight                   3.2 metres -> 3.6 metres
  + AerodynamicDragCoefficient  1.2        -> 1.1
  + CenterOfGravityHeight       1.5 metres -> 1.6 metres

  Others:
  * Boolean 'World.MouseGrabIgnoreOnce' used for working around Sdl.SDL_WM_GrabInput() bug.
  * Huge churn from renaming "SecuritySystem" to "SafetySystem".
  * debugCheckError() renamed to CheckForOpenGlError().
