This library has originally been compiled using Microsoft C/C++ 6.0.

It will also compile with newer compiler versions (tested with Visual Studio 2015 Update 1), however if you want to distribute such a recompiled binary with OpenBVE, users might have to install the corresponding version of the C++ runtime in order for the DLL to run.
