.SH "NAME"
OpenBVE \- train/railway simulator and game
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBopenbve\fR [\fB/route=\fIroute.csv\fR] [\fB/train=\fIdirectory\fR] [\fB/controls\fR|\fB/newgame\fR|\fB/options\fR|\fB/review\fR]

.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
OpenBVE is a realistic rail simulator.

The driving simulation is restricted to following a pre-determined loaded route, with
the focus being on the realism of the train driving experience.
OpenBVE also has an \fIArcade\fR mode where driving style and timetable-keeping
affect a running score.

The simulator is backwards compatible with existing 'BVE Trainsim'
route and train datafiles, which are readily available for no cost.  It
is cross-platform using CLI and Mono.

.br
.SH "GETTING STARTED"
To move the train, you need to do the following (with the default keyboard settings):

\fBf\fR Move the \fIreverser\fR to the forwards position.  (Opposite is \fBv\fR).
.br
\fB,\fR Release the \fIbrake\fR one notch; will be required 4-8 times before movement.  (Opposite is \fB.\fR).
.br
\fBz\fR Increase the \fIregulator\fR (power) one notch; may be required 1-2 times before movement.  (Opposite is \fBq\fR).

The major controls keys are arranged closely together
\fBq\fR-\fBa\fR-\fBz\fR for power control; \fB,\fR-\fB.\fR (comma and full-stop)
for braking and \fBf\fR-\fBv\fR for forwards/backwards direction.
Some electric trains have a combined accelerator+brake with a coast
(neutral) in the centre.  This is controlled with just the
\fBq\fR-\fBa\fR-\fBz\fR combination (and
forwards/backwards). Pressing the \fBa\fR key moves the controller one notch
closer to the coast/idle positioh, regardless of whether in power or braking mode.

\fBReturn\fR/\fBShift-Return\fR operate the horn.  Keys \fBF1\fR-\fBF5\fR select alternative camera angles.
\fBC-r\fR unlocks the camera to allow free movement (\fBr\fR to reset).  A large number of other keys exist
for interacting with complex signalling systems and operating the passenger doors whilst
in a station.  Most routes have a supplied timetable that can be displayed by pressing \fBC-t\fR.

.SH "LAPTOPS"
For laptops/notebooks, there is an alternate keyboard mapping (called "Default keyboard
assignment for Notebooks.controls"), which can be imported
via the \fICustomise Controls\fR tab.  The basic keys are the same,
but camera controls are moved off the numeric keypad.

.br
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB/controls\fR
Show Customise Controls screen; keyboard/mouse/joystick selection.
.TP
\fB/newgame\fR
Show Filemanager/route selector screen; choose activity (default).
.TP
\fB/options\fR
Show Options screen; display and quality settings.
.TP
\fB/review\fR
Show Review performance; score and incident log from previous activity.
.TP
\fB/route=\fIsomeroute.csv\fR
Path to the file with the route file ending \fI.csv\fR or \fI.rw\fR which describes the track, scenery and time-table.
.TP
\fB/train=\fItrain.dat\fR
A train/cab.  This should be a path to the directory, which contains the \fItrain.dat\fR description for the locomotive, train or cab.

.SH "DATAFILES"
Two elements are required, a route, and a train (often just a cab view
and performance metrics).  These can be selected using the
filemanager after OpenBVE is started.  Most routes have a
corresponding recommended train (for instance a particular model of Tube train on the
London Underground); if this train is located it will be selected by
default.

.br
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\&~/.config/OpenBve/
Saved keyboard configuration, display settings and score log.
.TP
/usr/share/games/bve/\fBTrain/\fR
Default location for packaged train directories (containing \fItrain.dat\fR).
.TP
/usr/share/games/bve/\fBRailway/Route/\fR
Default location for packaged railway route \fI.csv\fR files.
.TP
