						Interoperability
					</dt>
					<dd>
						On Windows systems with certain security policies, the .NET Framework can refuse to load plugins if users give openBVE insufficient privileges. This version includes a work-around that might solve this issue for some users, but in any case, users are adviced to let openBVE run with sufficient privileges to access its own files!

						Compatibility
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The mixing of multi-channel audio files to mono has been improved. The algorithm used tries to discard silent channels, then mixes the remaining channels to mono while trying to detect destructive interference (by resorting to any non-silent channel) and constructive interference (by rebalancing volume). Add-on developers should take notice that there is no perfect mixing algorithm that works for all files. Please just don't provide stereo sounds in the first place!

						All simulation-related components are now updated at an average of 75 times per second, but at least 50 times per second, regardless of framerate.
